  /** \brief Compute the sequence of joint values that correspond to a Cartesian path.

      The Cartesian path to be followed is specified as a direction of motion (\e direction, unit vector) for the origin of a robot
      link (\e link_name). The direction is assumed to be either in a global reference frame or in the local reference frame of the
      link. In the latter case (\e global_reference_frame is true) the \e direction is rotated accordingly. The link needs to move in a
      straight line, following the specified direction, for the desired \e distance. The resulting joint values are stored in
      the vector \e states, one by one. The maximum distance in Cartesian space between consecutive points on the resulting path
      is specified by \e max_step.  If a \e validCallback is specified, this is passed to the internal call to
      setFromIK(). In case of IK failure, the computation of the path stops and the value returned corresponds to the distance that
      was computed and for which corresponding states were added to the path.  At the end of the function call, the state of the
      group corresponds to the last attempted Cartesian pose.  During the computation of the trajectory, it is sometimes prefered if
      consecutive joint values do not 'jump' by a large amount in joint space, even if the Cartesian distance between the
      corresponding points is as expected. To account for this, the \e jump_threshold parameter is provided.  As the joint values
      corresponding to the Cartesian path are computed, distances in joint space between consecutive points are also computed. Once
      the sequence of joint values is computed, the average distance between consecutive points (in joint space) is also computed. It
      is then verified that none of the computed distances is above the average distance by a factor larger than \e jump_threshold. If 
      a point in joint is found such that it is further away than the previous one by more than average_consecutive_distance * \e jump_threshold,
      that is considered a failure and the returned path is truncated up to just before the jump. The jump detection can be disabled
